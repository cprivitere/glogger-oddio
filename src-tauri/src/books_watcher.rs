//! Books-directory watcher — ingests the game's own `.txt` book exports.
//!
//! The game writes one `.txt` per opened book into `<game_data_path>/Books/`
//! (`SkillReport_*`, `PlayerAge_*`, `HelpScreen_*`, `PlayerShopLog_*`,
//! `GuildMotd_*`, `MessageOfTheDay_*`, `NewQuestquest_*`). Files written while
//! glogger was closed previously sat unimported: the live coordinator only
//! sees books whose `ProcessBook` line streams through the running log tail.
//! This watcher mirrors `replay::spawn_player_prev_watcher` (background
//! thread, periodic scan, change detection) but tracks per-file mtimes and
//! needs no settings gate — book ingestion is unconditional.
//!
//! Content contract: live `ProcessBook` content carries escaped newlines
//! (`\n`), book files carry real newlines. Everything here normalizes through
//! `coordinator::normalize_book_content` once per file, so the shared
//! ingestion helpers in `coordinator` see identical content on both paths.
