## Investigations (Completed Research, No Code Changes Needed)

These are investigated items kept for reference — the research is done but the underlying limitation or blocker remains.

- **Item mods/augments not shown in inventory** — Player.log does NOT include TSys mod/augment data. Only `ProcessAddItem` (name + instance_id) and `ProcessUpdateItemCode` (stack size + type ID) are available. TSys data is only in VIP Inventory JSON export (snapshot imports already store it). Fundamental log format limitation.
- **Equipment display limited** — Equipment IS tracked from Player.log via `ProcessSetEquippedItems`, but only provides `slot` + `appearance_key` — no item names, stats, or details. A basic display could be built showing appearance slots only. Full details require VIP JSON export.
- **Match-3 winnings tracker** — No log events exist for the Match-3 minigame. Zero references in parser, chat logs, or Player.log. No feasible path without game-side changes. Minigame niche.
- **Monsters and Mantids winnings tracker** — Same as Match-3: no log events exist. No feasible path without game-side changes. Minigame niche.
- **Hot tips tracker** — No log events, chat channels, or CDN data references to "hot tips" found in current samples. Need to collect samples, or just find what Kaeus has...

## Blocked: Additional Log Examples Needed

These items are investigated but can't be resolved without new runtime captures or log samples.

- [x] ~~Bug: instant-snack foods missing from gourmand report~~ — **RESOLVED 2026-10-03 (live test session)**
  - CDN parse is NOT the problem: the `foods` table contains 57 Instant Snack rows (606 foods total), and all 422 eaten entries join cleanly (36 eaten instant snacks). The "0/0" bars were a **stale-import state**: dev DB last imported a report on 2026-06-28 while a newer `SkillReport` sat unimported — the Books-dir watcher (four-PR plan PR1) fixes this class of staleness. Verify a report import happened before debugging completeness math.
  - Note: `Flesh Lump` report lines carry race variants (`Flesh Lump (Elf)` etc.) — the tag stripper only removes `(HAS MEAT)`-class tags, so variant names match the CDN exactly. No fix needed (an earlier "variant matching gap" suspicion was a bug in the test script, not the app).

- [x] ~~Bug: rez counter not working~~ — **ROOT CAUSE FOUND 2026-10-03; FIX IMPLEMENTED**
  - The Action Emotes channel hypothesis was wrong: 22 `[Action Emotes]` lines reach the chat log today. The real gap: the game emits TWO rez phrasings — `<Caster> resuscitates <Target>` (parsed, populated the 78 historic rows) and `<Target> comes back to life!` (target-only, no caster named, UNPARSED). Sessions where the game uses the second phrasing left the counter silent.
  - **Fixed:** `chat_resuscitate_parser.rs` now parses the second shape with `caster_name = "Unknown"` (3 new tests incl. real-log lines and a spaced-target case). "Top rezzers" stays caster-based; "times rezzed" counting is now complete.

- [ ] Investigate detecting recipe learning without character.json import
  - **Investigation complete:** `ProcessUpdateRecipe(recipeId, completionCount)` and `ProcessLoadRecipes()` events already exist in `player_event_parser.rs`. `RecipeUpdated` events fire during gameplay when recipes are updated. Log events ARE generated — this feature is implementable without character.json dependency. Remaining work: wire coordinator handler to persist recipe state changes, update cook's helper to consume live events.
  - [ ] RELATED Bug: cook's helper not updating after buying new recipes
  - **Root cause identified:** Cook's helper loads recipes from CDN `items` data via `get_all_foods()`, but new recipes are only detected via character.json re-import or Books SkillReport file re-import. No live event integration exists. Fix: hook into `RecipeUpdated` parser events (which already fire — see recipe detection item above) to refresh the foods table incrementally.
    - STILL UNKNOWN: does this fire when a recipe is first learned, even if completion count is zero? need to capture a log for this. *(Live capture attempted 2026-10-03 but no unknown eligible recipe was available in-game — still open.)*
  - **Blocked on:** Log capture of a recipe being learned for the first time.
  - **Effort: Low-Medium (depends on recipe detection wiring) | Impact: Medium**

- [ ] Gardening helper — see `docs/plans/gardening-helper.md`
  - Parser events exist (`EntityDescriptionUpdated`), plan written. Garden almanac (Phase 0) is complete. But some garden mechanics (fertilizer counts, watering, growth timers) need additional in-game captures before implementation.
  - **Blocked on:** Additional garden captures to document fertilizer/watering/growth mechanics fully.
  - **Effort: Medium-Large | Impact: High**

## Medium Effort

- [ ] Bug: occasional inventory item miscounts
  - **Root causes identified:** (1) Chat-to-player event correlation uses a ±2 second window — mismatches fall back to stack_size=1. (2) Parser's 1-line lookahead buffer for deletions (`pending_deletes`) can fail if log lines reorder. (3) During catch-up replay, stack count corrections from chat may arrive before/after Player.log events depending on replay ordering. (4) Login doesn't treat inventory as a full state dump, so items from earlier sessions can pollute later ones. The widget itself warns "item tracking is not great right now." Fix requires reconciliation logic and smarter replay-mode handling.
  - **Effort: Medium-High (multiple interacting root causes) | Impact: Medium (data accuracy)**

- [ ] Smarter gamestate saving and initializing
  - **Investigation complete:** Three core problems: (1) `ProcessAddItem` always records stack_size=1 as defensive default; `correct_stack_from_chat()` patches this via status messages but timing is fragile during replay. (2) No detection of "login reload" full-state dumps vs. incremental changes — items are UPSERTed individually, never cleared on login during catch-up. (3) During catch-up replay (`live_mode=false`), inventory is not cleared on character login, so items from earlier replayed sessions pollute later ones. Fix requires: detecting login-phase full-state dumps, intelligently clearing transient state, coordinating stack-correction timing with chat log replay order.
  - **Effort: Medium-High | Impact: Medium (data accuracy)**

- [ ] Item provenance downstream features
  - Now that provenance is in the transaction ledger (item-provenance plan phases 1-5 complete), new analytics become possible: mining node yield stats per node type, vendor purchase history with total spend, kill loot breakdown by mob type, crafting yield analysis per recipe, "unknown source" diagnostic reports for discovering new signal patterns.
  - **Effort: Medium per feature | Impact: Medium-High (analytics depth)**

- [ ] Boss kill loot timers
  - Currently only player *deaths* are tracked (via `ChatCombatEvent::PlayerDeath` with killer detection). No reverse tracking exists (player kills boss). Would need to extend `chat_combat_parser` or `player_event_parser` for enemy kill events with boss identification. Loot timer logic would layer on top.
  - **Effort: Medium-High (parser extension + new feature) | Impact: Medium**

- [ ] Show work order completion state in tooltips for all characters
  - Work order tooltips should show completion/cooldown state across all tracked characters.
  - **Effort: Medium | Impact: Medium (multi-character awareness)**

- [ ] Evaluate ingestion pipeline / coordinator architecture
  - **Partial investigation (see `docs/architecture/pipeline-structure.md`):** Coordinator is a manual dispatch hub (~2K lines). No formal event bus — each new feature adds match arms. No history/audit tables for most domains (only `item_transactions` is append-only). No shared schema contract for Tauri event payloads. Current design works at this scale but these are real gaps to watch as features grow.
  - **Partial investigation:** Two-tier architecture: `PlayerLogWatcher` → `PlayerEventParser` → `GameStateManager` (50-event batches, 20ms flush window). Chat parallel: `ChatLogWatcher` → bulk insert + per-event status parsing. Main concerns: (1) chat-to-player correlation window is tight at ±2 seconds, (2) no query-side indexing on `game_state_inventory` for per-character/per-server lookups, (3) pending chat gains buffer ages items after 10s with no metrics on correlation failure rate, (4) all inventory deletes require 1-line lookahead. Overall reasonable design — main focus should be correlation tuning and reconciliation.
  - **Effort: Medium | Impact: Medium (reliability)**

- [ ] Investigate dashboard refresh issues
  - Reported as "weird page refresh issues." No explicit refresh/reload logic in `DashboardView.vue`. Main reactive trigger is `orderedWidgets` computed property tied to `useViewPrefs` + settings store. `useViewPrefs` debounces writes (500ms) but mutations can fire during transitions. Likely caused by reactive store updates triggering unexpected re-renders on pane resizing or settings updates. Needs runtime debugging to reproduce.
  - **Effort: Low-Medium (once reproduced) | Impact: Unknown**

- [ ] Color theme support
  - Investigate whether supporting user-selectable color themes makes sense. Low priority but high delight.
  - **Effort: Medium (investigation + implementation) | Impact: Low (personalization/delight)**

- [ ] Continue UI/UX standardization across screens
  - Some screens still don't look like they fit within the app, or have their own paradigms. Sidebars that don't use standardized panels, inconsistent patterns, etc. Should write a consolidated UI/UX checklist for new frontend features and then do a pass on existing screens against it.
  - **Progress:** Color tokens, typography scale, and widget sizing are now standardized. DataTable/FilterBar/SkeletonLoader shared components are available. 10 tables migrated. Next incremental steps: heading class standardization (see `docs/architecture/typography-audit.md`), remaining ~30 table migrations across Crafting/Surveying/DataBrowser, color token Tier 3 cleanup (see `docs/architecture/color-standards.md`).
  - **Effort: Medium (iterative) | Impact: Medium (consistency/polish)**

## Larger Efforts / Research Needed

- [ ] Quest tracking system (work orders, repeatables, Statehelm, active quests)
  - **See `docs/plans/quest-tracking.md`** — consolidated plan covering quest event parsing, repeatable cooldown tracking, work order cooldowns, Statehelm quest tracking, and active quest browsing. Prerequisite: add quest events to the player event parser.
  - **Effort: Large | Impact: High**

- [ ] Interactive zone maps — see `docs/plans/interactive-maps.md`
  - kaeus is working on this i believe.
  - **Effort: Large (mostly frontend) | Impact: High**

- [ ] Statehelm favor planner
  - Looks at storage vaults, finds appropriate gifts for Statehelm NPCs, creates a route to pick everything up before delivering. Respects remaining gift count needed per NPC that week. Combines storage data + gift preferences + route planner.
  - **Effort: Large | Impact: High (cross-system planning)**

- [ ] Work order route/crafting planner
  - Looks at all available work orders, shows where to go/craft/turn-in in optimal order using route planner. Depends on quest tracking system for work order state.
  - **Effort: Large | Impact: High (cross-system planning)**

- [ ] Quest turn-in helper
  - Looks at storage/inventory and active quests to find completable quests. Suggests pickup and turn-in routes using route planner. Depends on quest tracking system.
  - **Effort: Large | Impact: High (cross-system planning)**

- [ ] Track total owned quantity changes over time
  - Start with currencies, expand to other items. Currencies may be in character JSON, inventory JSON, or both. PG doesn't overwrite inventory reports in the reports folder — could backfill historical data from old reports. Character JSONs are overwritten on export though. **Infrastructure gap:** database supports point-in-time snapshots only (`character_item_snapshots`). `sales_history` tracks vendor transactions but no time-series quantity tracking exists. Needs: new tables for quantity history, periodic delta recording (event-driven or snapshot-based), UI for time-range queries and charts.
  - **Effort: Large (new infrastructure) | Impact: High (trend data is very valuable)**

- [ ] Skillbook autowatchwords
  - Automatically watch chat for item links of skill books the player could learn but doesn't own or know. Two modes: (1) books for currently-trained skills, (2) "future skill" mode where players select skills and we watch for any skillbooks they don't already own/know, even if skill level is too low to use them yet. **Investigation:** watchword system is fully operational (`watch_rules.rs`) with pattern matching and toast notifications. CDN has skillbook items with pattern `Skillbook_*`/`SkillBook_*` (e.g. `Skillbook_FoxInABox` with `AbilityRecipe` keyword). Implementation requires: (1) mapping skillbooks → skills via CDN items, (2) filtering against player's known skills, (3) auto-generating watch rules for desired skillbooks.
  - **Effort: Large | Impact: High (proactive skill progression)**

- [ ] Statehelm repeatable quest tracking — see `docs/plans/quest-tracking.md` §3
  - Sub-task: track statehelm renown possible vs earned.
  - **Effort: High | Impact: Medium-High**

- [ ] Casino arena bet tracker
  - Parse Player.log for arena fight announcements, bet confirmations, outcomes. Parse chat for arena NPC messages. Track bet history with win/loss stats and P&L. Needs a cross-source state machine (Player.log + chat correlation) — similar pattern to survey aggregator. Originally from Kaeus's GorgonBetTracker. Niche but popular feature.
  - **Effort: Large | Impact: Medium (niche but high engagement)**

- [ ] Write 'how to use' docs for each screen
  - Even brief docs for each screen would help users understand features. Could be in-app help or docs folder.
  - Need to have some standard place in the panel layout for a button or something, perhaps, that explains how to use it. maybe top right of the panel view? we will need a way to turn it off/on (not all panel layout consumers will want it) and then how to define what it contains.
  - **Effort: Large (breadth) | Impact: Medium (onboarding/discoverability)**

- [ ] Nightmare cave challenge door tracker
  - Need to look up all the challenges and see which ones we can track. Some are easy (1200 armor) and some are harder (have 4x 10-second premonition buffs). Could also track letters of authority as alternate path. **No existing code found** — no parser events, coordinator handlers, or database tables. Requires research into all challenge types + log event identification + new persistence layer.
  - **Effort: Large (research + implementation) | Impact: Medium (niche but useful)**

- [ ] Reevaluate test suite
  - Think about what tests make sense, what isn't giving value, and how to harden against future failures.
  - need to figure out if we can build some sample data or something that makes sense for tests.
  - **Effort: Large | Impact: Medium (reliability/confidence)**

- [ ] Analyze what should move from frontend to Rust
  - Some frontend logic may be better served on the Rust backend. Needs analysis to identify candidates.
  - **Effort: Large (research) | Impact: Medium (performance/architecture)**

- [ ] Macros or process interaction
  - Can we target the game process and send commands? Can we screen-read the process? Major research question with significant technical and policy implications.
  - We know from existing discussions that things like mouse/keyboard macros are okay.
  - **Effort: Large (research) | Impact: Unknown (depends on feasibility)**

- [ ] Auto cleanup of old exported/saved PG data
  - Old chatlogs, reports, etc. Let the user set their retention policies. Needs UI for policy config and safe file deletion logic.
  - **Effort: Large | Impact: Low-Medium (housekeeping feature)**
